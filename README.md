# miRNA Repertoire Evolution  

This repository contains the code and analysis pipelines used in our study on the evolution and organization of microRNA (miRNA) repertoires across species.  

## Overview  

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key post-transcriptional regulators, but the number and diversity of miRNA families vary widely across species.  
In this project, we show that this variability is not random, but reflects the optimization of gene regulatory network efficiency.  

Key findings:  
- Vertebrate miRNA repertoires are **selectively organized** to maximize transcriptome targeting while minimizing redundancy and genetic risk.  
- Invertebrate repertoires display **random seed usage patterns**.  
- miRNA **number correlates with diversity—not quantity—of 3′UTRs**.  
- Targeting efficiency emerges as an **intensive property** of seed sequence composition.  

These findings suggest that miRNA repertoires evolved not simply to expand regulation, but to ensure **robustness, adaptability, and efficient network performance**.
